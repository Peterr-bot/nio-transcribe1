So this logos who becomes flesh in Jesus can't really be God in the full sense. But the logos is the highest creature of God. The highest creature that's come forth from God is the logos. And then all of us other creatures are are underneath the logos.\nSo this very high semiquaside divine figure becomes flesh. Now what does flesh mean? Well, Aries thought it's pretty awkward to say that the logos is competing with a human mind and soul.\nSo, the human mind and soul are supplanted by the logos.
